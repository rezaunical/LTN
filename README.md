# LTN
Comparison of LTN for binary classification

# What to expect?
The goal is to evaluate the performance of LTN for binary classification tasks over different datasets.

# How to use [binary_classification.py]- In this file we use the same randomly generated dataset by the paper. 
If you use Jupyter in your system 
1- !git clone https://github.com/rezaunical/LTN.git
2- cd LTN # [or the proper directory]
3- !pip install ltn # [install the LTN library]
4- run binary_classification.py

# How to use [binary_moons.py]
all the same as before, except the part 4
