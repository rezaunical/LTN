# Binary Classification with and without LTN (same neural network size and structure)
Comparison of LTN for binary classification

# What to expect?
The goal is to evaluate the performance of LTN for binary classification tasks over different datasets. \
The files are: \
1- binary_classification.py # uses the same dataset of the original problem in the LTN paper. \
2- binary_moons.py # uses the moons dataset \
3- binary_iris.py # uses the iris dataset \
4- binary_synthetic # uses a synthetic dataset with 50 features \

# How to use  
If you use Jupyter in your system: \
1- !git clone https://github.com/rezaunical/LTN.git \
2- cd LTN # name of the directory in your system \
3- !pip install ltn # [install the LTN library] \
4- run binary_classification.py # or any other files inside the repository. \
